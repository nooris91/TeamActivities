# Team Learning Activity

Whenever you need to quickly add and remove items, but those items are always in order - a Linked List is a good option for the data structure. In this Lab, we will explore a **Singly Linked List**. You will then use this linked list as the foundation for the stack in your homework. 

**Precondition**: Make sure to review the page on structs, iterators, linked lists, and nodes in Canvas if you haven't!

## Team Activity
For this team activity, you will meet as a group at the scheduled meeting in MS Teams. The notes you take as a team should be stored in the files section of that meeting, and while not required, it is recommended that you create a nice naming scheme for the TAs to see the notes. They will also have access to your chat logs in the team.  They will use the attendance record to award points. 



## Part 1: Picturing Linked Lists

Given the following code, draw out the final memory structure similar to how you did in [Homework 02](https://github.com/CS5008-khoury-lionelle/hw02#linking-to-images).  You can draw with a program, or one person can draw (with direction from others) on paper and take a picture.

```c
typedef struct node
{
    int num_wins;
    int year;
    struct node *next;
} Pair;

Pair *new_node(int wins, int year, Pair *next)
{
    Pair *newNode = (Pair*)malloc(sizeof(Pair));
    newNode->num_wins = wins;
    newNode->year = year;
    newNode->next = next;
    return newNode;
}

Pair* create_simple_list() {
   Pair *fourth = new_node(40, 2008, NULL);
   Pair *third = new_node(30, 2007, fourth);
   Pair *second = new_node(20, 2006, third);
   Pair *head = new_node(10, 2005, second);
   return head;
}

int main() {
   Pair* head = create_simple_list();
   return 0;
}
```

In addition the the memory diagram you draw, a way you can show a linked list is the following:

```mermaid
graph LR
    HEAD --> A[10, 2005]
    A[10, 2005] --> B[20, 2006]
    B --> C[30, 2007]
    C --> D[40, 2008]
    D --> NULL
```


### Exploring the Code

Take a look at [linkedlist.h](linkedlist.h). Describe what you see and notice. Pay attention to the `push_front` and `add_back` functions. In your own words, describe to each other what each function does. 

The ‚ÄúPair *new_node‚Äù function creates a new node with the wins and year values and sets its next pointer to the provided next node.

‚ÄúNeuList* create_list‚Äù function creates a new linked list by allocating memory for a NeuList structure, which initializes its head pointer to NULL, and sets its size to 0. It returns a pointer to the newly created linked list.

‚Äúpush_front‚Äù function adds a new node to the front of the linked list. This function creates a new node using the new_node function and then sets its next pointer to the current head of the list, and after that, it updates the list's head pointer to point to the new node. 

‚Äúadd_back‚Äù function adds a new node to the end of the linked list. This function creates a new node using the new_node function, and then checks if the list is empty or not. In case, if the list is empty, the new node becomes the head of the list. And if the list is not empty, it traverses the list until it reaches the last node and sets the next pointer of that node to the new node.

‚Äúprint_list‚Äù function is used to print the contents of the linked list.

‚ÄúPair *find‚Äù function is used to search the linked list for a node with a specific year value and return a pointer to that node if found.

‚Äúfree_list‚Äù function is used to free the memory allocated for the linked list and its nodes.

#### Drawing Push Front
Using a similar drawing to the list above, draw out what happens when you call `push_front`. The important part is to help understand the order of the code, and what happens to the pointers.


### Iterating over a Linked List
As a group, write a function the iterates over the list, and prints out the values. The above list would look like the following:

```text
(10, 2005) -> (20, 2006) -> (30, 2007) -> (40, 2008) 
```

#### Test printing a list
Using the main function in [main.c], go ahead and build a list by looping over the arrays. Then, print out the list.

If you did it correctly, your print should look like
```text
(108, 2018) -> (93, 2017) -> (93, 2016) -> (78, 2015) -> (71, 2014) 
```

#### More Iteration Practice - Find
Looking at the function `Pair *find(PairList *list, int year)`, write a function that finds a node in the list, and returns it. If the node is not found, return NULL.

Add more tests to your main function to test this function.


#### More Iteration Practice - Free

So far, the program has a major error. The memory is not being freed! Write a function that frees the memory in the list. Discuss why you need a separate function to do this instead of just calling `free(list)` in the main function.

### Insert and Remove

As a group, discuss how you would insert and remove an item in the middle of the list. Draw out how that would look with pointers.  


## Part 2: Stack and Queue

Reviewing back to your CS 5001 class, you learned briefly about stacks and queues. Take a moment to discuss the differences, and then describe how a linked list could be used for either. Is it better for a stack or a queue? Why? This may involve some research, but why would you want to use a linked list over an array for a stack or queue? (and vise versa). 


## Part 3: Leet Code Practice 

Go to module 02, and you will see a link to a Leet Code Page. For every weekly team activity, you will be asked to go to past modules and work on the leet code practice as a team. (in this case, Module 02 is the only past module).

As a team, pick 2 problems to work on. Discuss your solutions and how you got there. It is alright if you work / discuss together, but one person should not tell the others how to do it. If a person is already familiar with the problem, they should help guide the others to the solution or maybe just be the person that types while the others talk. Remember, this is your study group, the more you help each other **understand**, the better you will all be!


## üìù Grading Rubric

This activity is manually graded by TAs looking at the attendance record and making sure notes were taken for the meeting.
